## What is a blockchain 
A blockchain is a distributed ledger, similar to a database, but rather than being controlled by a central authority (i.e., a firm like Google, small company, or individual) the ledger is dispersed across multiple computers, which can be located all over the world and run by anyone with an Internet connection. At its core, a blockchain is a ledger through which data is added and updated in real-time via consensus of the different nodes running the software in the network.

However, once the data is added to the ledger, it cannot be removed or edited like with a database. This is a product of the overall design of blockchains.
